If you had aksed me a few years back my answer would have been a resounding 'hell no!'. But alas... here we are.

I always felt like writing a blog would be a waste of my time, but I guess that was just me being a bit selfish. After all, I benefit a great deal from the many articles I read from really smart people all around the world creating interesting things. 

I'm mostly interested in software development with `java`, `python`, and `c++`. I'll also write about `ai`, `cybersecurity`, `microservices`, `entrepreneurship`, and whatever else comes to mind.

On some level these musings are mostly for me, but having them in the public space may prove beneficial to some. That's the hope.
